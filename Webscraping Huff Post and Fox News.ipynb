    "Next, I will scrape articles from the Huffington Post. As mentioned previously, the Huffington Post represents a left leaning media site, and, thus, will serve as the counterpart to Fox News. The goal is to end up with the same type of dataframe as Fox News with columns for description, publisher, text, and title. In the cell below, I use the Article command from the newspaper package. Moreover, I use the BeautifulSoup package to parse through each html page. I first define the function for collecting the information and then run it in a loop over all URLs. Since there are 26 articles per page, I need at least 9 pages to retrieve 222 articles--the same as Fox News. You can see that I loop through 11 pages (286 articles), to make sure I have enough articles just in case I have to remove those that are videos."
