In this project, my objective is to juxtapose how climate change is viewed by the left and the right in the United States. To begin my study, I will first scrape climate change related articles from both Fox News (https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/climate-change ) and the Huffington Post (https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/climate-change ). Once Iâ€™ve gathered this information, I will build statistical models to determine whether I can predict the source of the article based on the entire text of the article. A succesful model would point out these two political factions have different agendas when it comes to climate change.
