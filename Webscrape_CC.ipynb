    "In this project, my objective is to juxtapose how climate change is viewed by the left and the right in the United States. This is a follow up to a previous project in which I analyzed whether energy portfolios differed between red states and blue states (https://github.com/alab5037/Red-or-Blue/blob/master/Report%20(update).pdf ). Here's an excerpt from the paper regarding the conclusion of my study:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In conclusion, this study makes a strong case that blue states generate more electricity from biomass than red states. It can be argued that red states generate more power from coal compared to blue states, but the argument is a bit more tenuous considering the significance level for the covariate coal in Table 1 of the logistic regression model.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, I found evidence that energy policies differ between red and blue states as it pertains to clean/renewable energy--particularly, the adoption of biomass energy (waste, biofuels, etc.). Renewable energy proliferation is directly related to climate change since they are \"net-zero\", meaning that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are reduced 100% (Sims, 2003). To follow up on this research, I thought it would be interesting to further explore the political divide surrounding climate change. This time, I would like to get a better understanding of why it exists and where we stand today. To obtain insight on these questions, I explore the rhetoric of climate change articles from two mass media sites on different sides of the political spectrum: Fox News (right) and the Huffington Post (left). Fox News has been alleged by many to have a Republican Party bias in their news coverage; thus, it will be used as the right leaning media outlet in this study. Conversely, the Huffington Post has been said to be a liberal news and information site; hence, it will serve as the left leaning media outlet in this study. Where these media outlets lie on the political spectrum can be viewed in the following link: https://guides.lib.umich.edu/c.php?g=637508&p=4462444. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies suggest that the conservative media tends to downplay climate change. For example, a 2007 and 2008 analysis found that Fox News takes a more dismissive tone towards climate change than CNN and MSNBC, which are both left leaning (Feldman, Lauren, et al., 2011). Interestingly, this seems to have quite an influence on how conservatives perceive climate change. In a 2010 Gallup survey of 1,014 adults in the U.S., 74% of liberals agreed that “effects of global warming are already occurring,” whereas only 30% of conservatives concurred (Jones, 2010). In this study, I would like to confirm whether these findings still hold true in 2019. If the message surrounding climate change proves to be different between both media outlets, then it would suggest that this divide still exists. This might also explain why energy portfolios differ between blue and red states as evidence shows that the media impacts how people vote. For instance, a 2007 paper, titled, \"The Fox News Effect: Media Bias and Voting,\" found that the introduction of Fox News to cable programming led to an increase in the share of votes in Presidential elections between 1996 and 2000. In particular, Republicans gained 0.4 to 0.7 percentage points in the towns that broadcast Fox News (DellaVigna and Kaplan, 2007). \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the goal of this study is not to point fingers at any one party. I think that both sides bare responsibility for the current state of affairs. As mentioned before, studies have shown that right leaning media outlets tend to be more dismissive of climate change. However, it is also said that liberals push too hard and exaggerate climate change fears which can be counterproductive (Kreutzer, 2016). I hope that my results can help to stress that tackling climate change requires political unity. If both sides of the political spectrum cannot align, it will be arduous to take effective action against climate change. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin my study, I will first scrape climate change related articles from both Fox News and the Huffington Post. Once I’ve gathered this information, I will build statistical models to determine whether I can predict the source of the article based on the entire text of the article. A succesful model would point out these two political factions have different agendas when it comes to climate change."

    "Next, I will scrape articles from the Huffington Post. As mentioned previously, the Huffington Post represents a left leaning media site, and, thus, will serve as the counterpart to Fox News. The goal is to end up with the same type of dataframe as Fox News with columns for description, publisher, text, and title. In the cell below, I use the Article command from the newspaper package. Moreover, I use the BeautifulSoup package to parse through each html page. I first define the function for collecting the information and then run it in a loop over all URLs. Since there are 26 articles per page, I need at least 9 pages to retrieve 222 articles--the same as Fox News. You can see that I loop through 11 pages (286 articles), to make sure I have enough articles just in case I have to remove those that are videos."

    "Now that I have my data, I can perform various statistical analyses in order to ascertain the source of an article,  Fox News or Huffington Post. I will first create an array of dummy variables using the count vectorizer. The count vectorizer counts the number of times a token shows up in the document and uses this value as its weight. Furthermore, I will also implement the tfidf vectorizer which is similar to the count vectorizer, but now the weight also depends on the occurrence of a word in the entire corpora. With this newly created array, I will try to predict whether a given article belongs to Fox News or Huffington Post. In this study, I will use three models: 1) multinomial naive bayes 2) k nearest neighbors 3) random forest. "

    "Next, I explore how the language between both sites actually differ by examining the coefficients of the model. The coefficients are essentially the log of the estimated probability of a feature given the positive class. Since Fox News is labeled as '1' (positive class) and the coefficients listed below are negative, the model conveys that if an article contains 'commerce committee', for example, then it is less likely to be classified as a Fox News article. In other words, they are more likely to be found in Huffington Post articles. Because there are many words with coefficient around -11, it would be difficult to make a general statement about what they all mean in regards to climate change. However, if I pick out a few words like 'overfishing', 'crisis threatens','plastic pollution','coral bleaching', etc. an argument can be made that these words convey the adverse impacts of climate change. This makes sense as we would expect the Huffington Post, a liberal media outlet, to push for climate change action."

    "Overall, my results show that Fox News and the Huffington Post convey a different rhetoric regarding climate change. When models were applied to tfidf vectorized data, they achieved an average accuracy of approximately 82%. This is pretty good especially when considering that the most successful model (multinomial naive bayes) predicted nearly 87% of articles correctly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, it is a little more difficult to pinpoint how exactly the rhetoric differs. Using the entire text of articles allowed me to leverage more data and build stronger models, but interpretation is a tall order due to the sheer amount of features. From what I did find, however, it seems that the Huffington Post tends to focus on the negative impacts that climate change has on the environment compared to Fox News. This aligns with what previous research has shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The take away from this study is that there still exists a considerable divide between the left and right as it pertains to climate change. This argument is strengthened when combined with the results from my previous study. Ultimately, I believe both sides need to align in order to see significant progress in tackling climate change."
